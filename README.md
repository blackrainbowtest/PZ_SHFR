# Zomboid Farm mod

### Description:
</summary>

This mod greatly expands the farming options in the game. In the original version of the game, only 8 types of plant seeds are available. Our mod adds over 26 new types of seeds, allowing players to grow a variety of crops and enjoy a richer gameplay experience. And this is just the beginningâ€”even more plant species are planned to be added in the future.

Additionally, in this mod, trees do not disappear when harvested, allowing players to harvest fruits multiple times without having to replant the trees. This makes farming more realistic and convenient.

Try our mod and discover new farming possibilities!

## Important!

Most of the plants will be redrawn, so do not hesitate to give comments in the comments below. Your opinion is very important to me.  
At the moment, the Chekbox weather impact settings are not working.

At the moment, the following plants have the final species, however, if they are not suitable for the color scheme, the game will be changed.
